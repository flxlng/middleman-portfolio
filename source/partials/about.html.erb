        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Felix, a software developer and business graduate from Hamburg, Germany. I initially studied Business Administration in Germany and the Netherlands, but soon found my true calling in technology. This led me to Tokyo, Japan, where I immersed myself in coding and embraced various cultural challenges. With tenacity and dedication, I thrive on turning ideas into reality. My passion for technology and boundless curiosity drive me to explore its endless possibilities.</p>
